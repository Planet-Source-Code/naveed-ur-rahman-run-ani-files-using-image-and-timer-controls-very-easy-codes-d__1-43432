Understanding Animation File (*.ani) Binary:

RIFF Block: (Must Present if all animation files)

	R	I	F	F		(Verification of ANI file)
	n1	n2	n3	n4		(Full Animation File Size)
	A	C	O	N		(Verification of ANI file)


Information Block/Rough Block: (Not necessary in all animation files)
Rough Block #1 (An Example)
	L	I	S	T
	n1	n2	n3	n4		(This Block Size)
Rough Block #2 (An Example)
	X1	X2	X3	X4
	n1	n2	n3	n4		(This Block Size)
				...(more blocks may be present)

	a	n	i	h		(animation header - Sub Block of RIFF block)
	$	0	0	0		(Leave it)
	$	0	0	0		(Leave it)
	n1	n2	n3	n4		(Number of Frames)
	n1	n2	n3	n4		(Number of Visible Frames)

	0	0	0	0		(Leaeve it)
	0	0	0	0		(Leaeve it)
	0	0	0	0		(Leaeve it)
	0	0	0	0		(Leaeve it)
	10	0	0	0	

	n1	n2	n3	n4		(Leave it)
RIFF Block End.

RATE Block (Not necessary in all animation files):
	r	a	t	e		(Rate block begins)
	n1	n2	n3	n4		(Size of rate block)


Information Block/Rough Block: (Not necessary in all animation files)
Rough Block #1 (An Example)
	S	e	q	[space]		(Some block)
	n1	n2	n3	n4		(This Block Size)
Rough Block #2 (An Example)
	X1	X2	X3	X4		(Some block)
	n1	n2	n3	n4		(This Block Size)
				...(more blocks may be present)

Delay sequence (Frame one-by-one):
	n1	n2	n3	n4		(Frame 1 delay calculation)
	n1	n2	n3	n4		(Frame 2 delay calculation)
	n1	n2	n3	n4		(Frame 3 delay calculation)
	n1	n2	n3	n4		(Frame ... delay calculation)
				...(More frames delays)
RATE Block End.

LIST Block: (Must Present if all animation files)
	L	I	S	T
	n1	n2	n3	n4		(List Block Size)
	f	r	a	m		(Indication of Begining of frames data)
	
Icons Integrity:

	i	c	o	n		(Begining of an icon of a frame)
	n1	n2	n3	n4		(Total size of integrated icon)
	Now the icon begin.... after this icon
	i	c	o	n		(Begining of an NEXT icon of a frame)
	n1	n2	n3	n4		(Total size of integrated icon)
	Now the second icon begin.... and so on (to the total number of frames)

LIST Block End.
File End.

Calculating Values Of Lines 
			n1	n2	n3	n4
Solution: If N is the Value of the above line then
			N = n1 + n2*256 + n3*256*256 + n4*256*256

This is all what I search in the binary of ANIMATION files. If you know some thing MORE then you can make changes.
